# brain_tumor_detection
This repository contains a project for classifying brain tumors using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project utilizes two different models: a custom CNN and a pre-trained ResNet50 model. The custom CNN is designed from scratch, while the ResNet50 model is used for transfer learning.
